# Scriptwriter — beat sheets that sound like the creator, not AI

The creator brings a pick (a winning competitor video from research/ideation, with URL) or a
raw idea. Claude turns it into a **beat sheet** — hook + numbered beats + CTA — staged
in Notion, ready to film.

The anti-slop mechanism is **imitation, not description**. LLMs write generic when
given style adjectives; they nail a voice when shown verbatim examples and told "write
the next one." So the draft is always written with 2-3 of the creator's own top transcripts
(same format, pulled from `voice-corpus/`) sitting in context, plus `voice-dna.md` as
the explicit rulebook, plus a fresh-context lint pass at the end.

## Freshness Check

Compare `last_updated` above to today's date. If more than 2 weeks have passed, tell the user this skill file may be out of date and suggest re-pulling/reinstalling the `ai-video-marketing` repo (`git pull`, or re-running whichever install command they used) before relying on it — then continue with the workflow below regardless.

## The Flow

```
1. GATHER  — pick or idea. Decide Short-form vs Long-form.
2. DECOMPOSE — (source video only) subagent transcribes + returns the format skeleton.
3. LOAD VOICE — voice-dna.md + find_voice.py few-shot pulls + knowledge/ context.
4. TWIST   — short conversation: what's the creator's angle on this format?
5. DRAFT   — hook first, then full-sentence beats, in their voice.
6. LINT    — fresh-context voice-lint subagent. Fix what it flags.
7. DELIVER — show in chat, iterate, then create the Notion page.
```

## Step 1 — Gather

Take what the creator gives:
- **A pick** from a research report or chat ideation: source URL + concept line. The
  source is the format model to twist.
- **Raw idea** — no source video; skip Step 2.

Decide **Short-form** (IG reel / Shorts) or **Long-form** (YouTube). This drives the
hook artifact: **short-form hook = the first 3-5 seconds the creator speaks on camera;
long-form hook = the video title.** Never substitute a caption or text overlay.

## Step 2 — Decompose the source (subagent — only when there's a source URL)

Transcription happens HERE, in the subagent. Spawn one subagent (Sonnet) that:

1. Transcribes the source with the sibling `transcribe-url` skill's script, from the
   repo root, with an explicit output dir (the script's default is cwd-relative):
   `bash .claude/skills/transcribe-url/scripts/transcribe-url.sh <url> transcripts/url`.
   Then reads the markdown it wrote (path is printed at the end of the run). That
   script owns the engine (YouTube captions when they exist, otherwise the shared
   faster-whisper venv it bootstraps itself). One path, no fallbacks: if it fails
   twice, stop and tell the creator.
2. Returns a **format skeleton**: beat-by-beat structure (what each beat does, not
   what it says), hook mechanic, pacing notes, CTA mechanic, runtime.
   - **Short-form source:** also return the full transcript (it's under a minute).
   - **Long-form source:** return the skeleton ONLY — never load a full long-form
     transcript into the orchestrator. Include the spoken intro (first ~150 words)
     as the sole verbatim excerpt.

## Step 3 — Load the voice

In this order (compiled layer before raw sources):

1. `voice-dna.md` — the rulebook: openers, fillers, closers, energy markers, anti-patterns.
2. `knowledge/creator-ai-positioning.md` (the positioning page, fixed filename),
   `knowledge/winning-hooks.md`, `knowledge/reusable-script-formats.md` — positioning
   + proven shapes. When present: `knowledge/` starts empty until `knowledge-compile`
   runs, so skip these on a fresh install and lean on `backbone/` + the corpus.
3. **Few-shot pulls** — query the corpus, never read it wholesale. Commands run from
   the repo root (`python` on Windows):

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/scriptwriter/scripts/find_voice.py --list                              # see available tags
python3 .claude/skills/scriptwriter/scripts/find_voice.py --format giveaway --top 3 --full    # short-form examples
python3 .claude/skills/scriptwriter/scripts/find_voice.py --platform youtube --top 3 --excerpt 400   # long-form intros
python3 .claude/skills/scriptwriter/scripts/find_voice.py --keyword "workflow" --era <current-era-tag> --top 5
```

Pull **2-3 entries matching the target format** and keep them in context while
drafting. Short-form: `--full` (they're 150-400 words). Long-form: `--excerpt 400`
(the voice register lives in the intro; full YT transcripts blow up context).
Prefer the current-era tag (see `--list` output; e.g. in one corpus the current era is
tagged `current` and the older one `previous`): same voice, current niche.
Reach into the older era only when the format has no current-era example.

## Step 4 — The twist conversation

The twist lives here. Propose **one recommended angle** (plus a one-line alternate if
there's a genuinely different read): how the creator's proof, offer, and niche (per the
CLAUDE.md Creator Profile and `backbone/`) pour into the source format. Real receipts
only, pulled from `backbone/messaging.md`'s proof bank: real numbers, client/member
results, things the creator actually runs. Nothing invented, nothing borrowed.

Keep it short — propose, let them redirect. Don't interrogate. (Say "pick 2" / "row 2"
in chat, never bare "#2" — the renderer linkifies it.)

## Step 5 — Draft the beat sheet

Write the script as numbered beats. Rules:

- **Every bullet is a complete sentence, ~15-25 words, that reads like real script
  direction.** The creator scans this on their phone between takes — fragments are too
  cryptic. Example: "Open on the finished result already on screen, say the hook over
  it, then cut to your face for the promise." Not "result → hook → face."
- **Spoken lines are written out verbatim, in their voice** — drafted against the
  few-shot transcripts. If a line wouldn't survive being read aloud next to them,
  rewrite it before moving on.
- **Hook first.** Short-form: the exact spoken line (3-5s). Long-form: the title.
  Pull shapes from `knowledge/winning-hooks.md`; for a full proven-hook spread, run
  the `hook-generator` skill instead of improvising new structures.
- **One CTA.** Comment-keyword giveaway ("Comment X and I'll send it", keyword per
  `backbone/offer.md`) or a direct mention of the offer (name/price per
  `backbone/offer.md`). **Never** anything on `backbone/offer.md`'s "What is NOT sold"
  list.
- Structure: **Hook → Beats → CTA → Delivery notes** (energy, demo moments, b-roll
  flags). Short-form ≈ 6-12 beats. Long-form: intro beats verbatim, body as sectioned
  beats.

## Step 6 — Voice lint (subagent)

Spawn ONE fresh-context subagent with: the draft, `voice-dna.md`, and the same 2-3
few-shot transcripts. Its only job is to attack the draft line by line:

- Flag anything the creator wouldn't say: corporate phrasing, buzzwords, hedging,
  soft-sells, LinkedIn cadence, AI-isms ("delve", "game-changer", "in today's world",
  "let's dive in").
- Flag rhythm misses: lines too long to say in one breath, missing their tics where
  they'd land naturally, openers/closers that aren't theirs.
- Flag CTA violations (anything that isn't the comment keyword or the offer in
  `backbone/offer.md`; anything on its "What is NOT sold" list).
- For every flag: quote the line, say why, propose the rewrite in their register.

Apply the fixes you agree with. If the lint pass guts more than half the draft, the
few-shot selection was wrong — go back to Step 3 and pull better-matched examples.

## Step 7 — Deliver

Show the final beat sheet in chat. Iterate until the creator's happy. Then create the
Notion page (`notion-pipeline.md` has the live schema — load it for IDs and shapes):

- Write with the Notion MCP `notion-create-pages` tool. Parent = the **Data source ID**
  from `notion-pipeline.md` (not the Database ID). Set the page icon per the convention
  in `notion-pipeline.md` on every create.
- **Title** = working title (long-form: the title IS the hook). **Status** = `Scripting`.
  **Format** = `Short-form` / `Long-form`. **Source URL** = source video on twist picks.
- **Never set Type** — leave the multi-select blank; the creator tags funnel placement themselves.
- Body = the beat sheet: Hook, Beats, CTA, Delivery notes.

## Rules

- **Imitation over instruction.** No draft is written without few-shot corpus pulls
  in context. If `voice-corpus/` is missing or untagged, stop and say so (build it
  with the `voice-corpus-builder` skill first).
- **One hardened path.** No fallback chains in transcription or Notion writes — if
  the primary path fails twice, stop and tell the creator.
- **Long-form sources stay in the subagent.** The orchestrator only ever sees the
  skeleton + intro excerpt.
- **Don't improvise hook structures.** Shapes come from `knowledge/winning-hooks.md`,
  the corpus, or the `hook-generator` skill.
- **Document, don't manufacture.** Twists are built on things the creator actually does and
  results that actually happened (the `backbone/messaging.md` proof bank).
- **The script must survive the read-aloud test.** If a line sounds like a post, not
  like the creator talking to a friend, it doesn't ship.

## Files

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `.claude/skills/scriptwriter/scripts/find_voice.py` (run from repo root) | Slices `voice-corpus/` by format / era / keyword / platform; returns ranked entries with transcripts. Query, don't read raw. |
| `../transcribe-url/scripts/transcribe-url.sh` | Sibling-skill dependency: the one transcription path for Step 2 (bootstraps its own whisper venv). Ships alongside this skill. |
| `../../../voice-corpus/` | the creator's own top performers, verbatim, tagged. The few-shot source of truth (built by the `voice-corpus-builder` skill). |
| `../../../voice-dna.md` | The explicit voice rulebook — guardrails on top of the examples. |
| `../../../notion-pipeline.md` | Live Notion schema — load before any Notion write. |
| `../../../backbone/offer.md`, `../../../backbone/messaging.md` | The offer (CTA name/price, comment keyword, "What is NOT sold" list) and the proof bank for the twist. Never hardcode either. |
